# üêç PythonFu

> *Mastery in Python, one step at a time.*

**PythonFu** is an open, evolving project dedicated to providing free, practical, and beginner-friendly resources for learning Python and its real-world applications.  
The name ‚ÄúFu‚Äù is inspired by the Eastern concept of mastery ‚Äî as in *KungFu* ‚Äî and represents the ongoing path of deepening skill and understanding.

This project aims to grow continuously and serve as a living collection of Python knowledge.

> *‚ÄúKungFu is not in style or form ‚Äî it‚Äôs in patience, practice, and persistence. So is Python.‚Äù*
